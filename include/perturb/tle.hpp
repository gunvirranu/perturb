/// values, and lastly checksum. This allows you to assume, for example, that
/// if there is a `CHECKSUM_MISMATCH`, then none of the previous errors
/// occurred first, and so the invalid checksum is the *only* issue.

/// from a string and use it for SGP4 in one go, then better to use the
/// `Satellite::from_tle` methods.
///
/// The primary purpose of this type is when the `PERTURB_DISABLE_IO` flag is
/// set, as then there's no way to construct a `Satellite` from a TLE. In such
/// a case where all I/O and string processing is removed, this type still
/// allows you to construct and initialize a `Satellite` manually. However, you
/// must handle your own method of creating the `TwoLineElement`s.
